1.0.1 released 2008-11-02

 [NEW FEATURES]

    - Support for composite tokens; this also fixes a bug with using
      IP-based tokens for users with cookies disabled.

    - Native support cookie tokens; use csrf_conf('cookie', $name) to
      specify the name of a cookie that the CSRF token should be
      placed in.  This is useful if you have a Squid cache, and need
      to configure it to ignore this token.

    - Tips/tricks section in README.txt.

    - There is now a two hour expiration time on all tokens.  This
      can be modified using csrf_conf('expires', $seconds).

    - ClickJacking protection using an iframe breaker.  Disable with
      csrf_conf('frame-breaker', false).

 [BUG FIXES]

    - CsrfMagic.send() incorrectly submitted GET requests twice,
      once without the magic token and once with the token.  Reported
      by Kelly Lu <lubird@gmail.com>.
